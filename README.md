# Rseurat

## Single Cell RNA-seq Course

Lectures are in `rmd` subfolder (even if they're not RMarkdown: e.g. shiny apps, plain markdown or R scripts). Filenames start with two digits (e.g. 14) to set the correct ordering while using alphaetical criteria, e.g. all that's in the range 10-19 goes into Day \#1.<!--Some numbers were skipped on purpose, to allow adding new (mini-)lectures in the future without going through the hassle of renaming everything...-->
