<!--
- Lectures are in `rmd` subfolder (with Q&A in `polls` subfolder). Filenames start with two digits (e.g. 14) to set the correct ordering while using alphabetical criteria, e.g. all that's in the range 10-19 goes into Day \#1.
- rmd/_site.yml lists all lectures, day 1 is super loaded, while day 2 have more room (specially if you were to skip or drop enrichR)
- everything at rmd_archived subfolder is leftover from the development process of this course. safe to ignore.
- .github/workflow has deploy.yml to build the gh-pages, there's a dispatch button at gh.com/o/Rseurat/actions
- please check the `Makefile` to enable rendering the site locally (e.g. debugging)
- all code blocks should be labeled and formatted/ styled (makefile)
- update the package library snapshot in deep19:/scratch/local
- links to datasets are updated in both deploy.yml and 10_PkgInstall. And copy downsampled datasets in deep19:/scratch/local
- CSV files at polls/ are to be uploaded to https://www.polleverywhere.com/activities , and then (in bulk) configure it so that questions only accept 1 time answer (no editions).
- after the course, you will probably want to take notes of what needs changing (e.g. guided by the in-course polls or even the survey carried by the end of it).
