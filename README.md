# Rseurat

## Single Cell RNA-seq Course

Lectures are in `rmd` subfolder (with Q&A in `polls` subfolder). Filenames start with two digits (e.g. 14)
to set the correct ordering while using alphabetical criteria, e.g. all that's
in the range 10-19 goes into Day \#1.
Note for instructors: see the HTML comment below.

<!--
- please check the `Makefile` to enable rendering the site locally. And formatting the code blocks.
- .github/workflow has deploy.yml to build the gh-pages, there's a dispatch button at gh.com/o/Rseurat/actions
- rmd/_site.yml lists all lectures, day 1 is super loaded, while day 2 have more room (specially if you were to skip or drop enrichR)
- update the package library snapshot in deep19:/scratch/local
- links to datasets are updated in both deploy.yml and 10_PkgInstall. And copy downsampled datasets in deep19:/scratch/local
- everything at rmd_archived subfolder is leftover from the development process of this course
- all code blocks should be labeled
