Lectures are in `rmd` subfolder (even if they're not RMarkdown: e.g. shiny apps, plain markdown or R scripts). Filenames start with two digits (e.g. 14) to set the correct ordering while using alphaetical criteria, e.g. all that's in the range 10-19 goes into Day \#1. Some numbers were skipped on purpose, to allow adding new (mini-)lectures in the future without going through the hassle of renaming everything...

Be aware that these docs have `POLL` and `HOMEWORK` keywords thrown in, the POLL is to be carried out in the classroom. The `HOMEWORK` is always optional (this is an intensive course), and expands upon the basic programming skills; often without aiming to the 'core' learning; that's obviously saved for the actual classes. For this very reason, the work that's being asked is accompanied by a hint that is meant to be a huge time-saver for the students.
