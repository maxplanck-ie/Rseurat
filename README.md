## Single Cell RNA-seq Course

### Lectures

Files in `rmd` subfolder. Filenames start with two digits (e.g. 14) to set correct ordering, e.g. all that's in the range 10-19 goes in the first day. Some numbers were skipped on purpose, to allow adding new mini-lectures in the future without going through the hassle of renaming everything...

Be aware that these docs have `POLL` and `HOMEWORK` keywords thrown in, the POLL is to be carried out in the classroom. The `HOMEWORK` is always optional (this is an intensive course), and expands upon the basic programming skills; often without aiming to the 'core' learning; that's saved for the actual classes. For this very reason, the work that's being asked is accompanied by a hint that is meant to be a huge time-saver for the students.
