# day1

 - make repo available via zip file 
 - concrete instructions for workbench + setup a new project from existing directory
 - update where and how normalized values are stored (after NormalizeData)
 - do the leading rmd numbers actually mean something ? (10,12,13,14,16 ?)
 
 # day2
 
 - poll1/poll2/poll3 it's not clear what is meant:  either a default slot is taken for a function (and it doesn't matter), or you are forced to run the previous steps (?), or the results will actually be different.
 - in mast, the l2fc's are calculated between cells that express the GOI, but the proportion can be skewed. This could be more elaborated upon

# day3

- poll1 what is a 'top' DE gene (l2fc / padj / ?)
- poll std deviation (abs values ?) or percentage of variable explained ?

# day4

 - heatmap w/ counts don't really tell a lot to compare clusters ? -> clustree (?)
 -
