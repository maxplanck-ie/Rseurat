Poll,Multiple choice,What would happen if we ran `FindVariableFeatures` after `ScaleData`?,"Nothing, the resulting list of genes would be the same",The resulting list of genes may have differences,Seurat would throw an error,,
Poll,Multiple choice,What would happen if we skip `ScaleData`? Would PCA be affected?,"Nothing, PCA is a robust procedure",The resulting PCA has biases introduced by the absolute values of our count matrix,Seurat would throw an error,,
Poll,Multiple choice,What would happen if we skip `NormalizeData`? Would UMAP be affected?,"Nothing, UMAP is a stochastic procedure so all the randomness corrects itself","UMAP runs, the looks are far from perfect, but the downstream DE testing won’t be affected so my conclusions are safe","The resulting PCs would be biased, UMAP runs, but the result is biased too.","The resulting PCs would be biased, so UMAP is bound to run into errors",
Poll,Multiple choice,Would it be any difference if we ran `FindNeighbors` and `FindClusters` but only after UMAP?,"Nothing, clustering is a complementary but parallel process to UMAP","Impossible, UMAP will fail beforehand",The clusters’ sparsity would change,Depends! If we wanted to FindNeighbors using reduction=’umap’,
Poll,Multiple choice,"Given that genes used for clustering are the same genes tested for differential expression, Would you interpret the (adjusted) p-values without concerns?","No concerns, the workflow is trusted by tons of citations.",I’d be cautious…,,,
Poll,Multiple choice,Which marker gene is the most expressed in cluster 1 when comparing it to cluster 2?,S100A,LYZ,S100A8,S100A9,
Poll,Multiple choice,"What would happen if we used `ident.1 = 2`, and `ident.2 = 1` instead?","There’s no symmetry, nor proportional law in the results.",Both Avg. Log2 FC and P-values would be different.,Average log2 Fold Change sign would swap (FC * -1),Average log2 Fold Change would be inverted (1 / FC),
Poll,Multiple choice,How would you extract the 'gene signature' of a given cluster? By DE testing with…,"ROC analysis, against all remaining clusters","Logistic regression, against all remaining clusters","Any test, against the most distant cell type as the cleanest baseline","Any test, against the remaining clusters",
