Poll,Multiple choice,Run the UMAP without seed a couple of times and compare. Is it more affected than t-SNE? Or less?,"UMAP is more sensible, plot has changed drastically",t-SNE is more sensible. UMAP counteracts with its emphasis on global structure.,Both are equally sensible,"Being stochastic means that any behaviour can be expected, depends on the seed…",
Poll,Multiple choice,Would decreasing the number of PCs fed onto the clustering algorithm change our visualization? Would you say the results are 'better'?,"No, it didn’t change at all","Yes, and it’s better with many PCs","Yes, but it’s worst with many PCs","Yes, and it’s better with few PCs","Yes, but it’s worst with few PCs"
Poll,Multiple choice,Could you have the UMAP projection onto 3 axis instead of 2?,Sure,Why would I?,No,Yeah!! Awesome!!!,
