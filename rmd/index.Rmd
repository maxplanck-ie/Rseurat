Seurat is an R package designed for QC, analysis, and exploration of
single-cell RNA-seq data. Seurat aims to enable users to identify and interpret
sources of heterogeneity from single-cell transcriptomic measurements, and to
integrate diverse types of single-cell data. All methods emphasize clear,
attractive, and interpretable visualizations, and were designed to be easily
used by both dry-lab and wet-lab researchers. Seurat is developed and
maintained by the Satija lab and is released under the MIT license.

# Requirements:

* **R-language**: has been covered by our introductory
  [course](https://maxplanck-ie.github.io/Rintro).

* **Bulk RNA-seq**: has been covered by our introductory
  [course](https://maxplanck-ie.github.io/Rdeseq2).

* an **account for [workbench](https://workbench.ie-freiburg.mpg.de)**: We will
  use the Rstudio server at the MPI-IE. If you do not have an account yet, you
  will need to request a 'linux' account from core-IT. Please do so well before
  the course starts. You can use a local installation of R as well. Note that
  we will be using R 4.1.3 during this course.

* **Know your keyboard!** Special characters will be needed throughout the
  course, e.g. $ , | , [, ], {, }, >, <, #, ~, &, ^, %, !, ?
