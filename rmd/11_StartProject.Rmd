## Workbench users

> âŒ¨ðŸ”¥ Exercise: Create a new project and clone the source files we will be using, from GitHub.

If you are using Workbench, start a new session. Then, go to the Menu:

* `File` -> `New project...` -> `Version Control` -> `Git`

> Repository URL: https://github.com/maxplanck-ie/Rseurat  
> Project directory name: chose a folder name  (e.g. MYFOLDER)

* create the project as a subdirectory under your group volume (e.g. /data/PI/group/MYFOLDER), or a processing volume (/data/processing/MYFOLDER), or the scratch space (/scratch/local/MYFOLDER)

## Local users

Go to <https://github.com/maxplanck-ie/Rseurat> , click on the green `< > Code` dropdown button and select `Download ZIP`.
Save the file to an appropriate location and extract its content.

Now open your Rstudio IDE, and set the working directory to the folder you have just extracted.

## Verification

If it worked, you should have a new session, and in your console you will retrieve your chosen project directory:

 > getwd()

and you should be able to see the documents:

 > list.files('rmd')

which should contain subfolders 'datasets' and 'images', along with a bunch of RMarkdown documents. The latter, is the "raw" content of what you find online at <http://maxplanck-ie.github.io/Rseurat>.

Our filenames start with two digits (e.g. `14_FirstSteps.Rmd`) to set the correct ordering while using alphabetical criteria, e.g. all that's in the range 10-19 goes into Day `#1`. The file `_site.yml` is an index (it defines the "Modules" menu on the website).
